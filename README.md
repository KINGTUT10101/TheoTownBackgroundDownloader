## Overview
This Python script will automatically download the most popular screenshots from the [TheoTown Gallery](https://forum.theotown.com/gallery/). The script has one CLI argument, which is the filepath you'd like to save the images to.

I've also included a BAT file, which will automatically download the images to the TheoTown_Gallery folder inside your Images folder. If you'd like this to run on startup, make a shortcut to the BAT file and place it inside your [startup folder](https://www.howtogeek.com/754239/how-to-access-the-windows-10-startup-folder/#:~:text=To%20access%20the%20Startup%20folder,program%20when%20your%20PC%20starts.).
